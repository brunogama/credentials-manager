Use TDD for code conversation

1. Write failing test
2. Execute test - it must fail
3. Implement minimal code to make the test pass
4. Execute test - it must pass
5. Refactor
6. Test
7. Keep in this cycle until the spec is implemented
8. Commit code implemented and tests - using convetional commit specification
