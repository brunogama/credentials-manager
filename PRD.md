# Product Requirements Definition (PDR)
## Security Enhancements for Credential Management Scripts

### Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2024-12-19
- **Status**: Draft
- **Author**: Security Enhancement Review

### Executive Summary

This PDR outlines comprehensive security enhancements for the credential management script suite (`credmatch`, `store-api-key`, `dump-api-keys`, `get-api-key`). The recommendations are prioritized based on security impact, implementation complexity, and immediate value to users.

## üéØ Current Security Status

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features
- **History Protection**: Commands automatically prevented from shell history
- **Secure Input**: Password/API key inputs use secure methods (`read -s`, `stty -echo`)
- **Variable Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of sensitive data from memory
- **Warning Systems**: Real-time detection and warnings for sensitive command arguments
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive security guidance in usage messages

### üîÑ Areas for Enhancement
The following sections outline additional security measures to further strengthen the credential management system.
