This foundational component enables all other security enhancements to be configurable and maintainable.",

Implement load_security_config() function that validates config file permissions (600), sources configuration with error handling, and sets secure defaults. Include config file creation with secure permissions and validation functions.",
      "verificationCriteria": "Configuration file created with 600 permissions, load_security_config() function validates and loads settings correctly, default configuration covers all security aspects, config validation prevents insecure settings",
      "analysisResult": "Implement comprehensive security enhancements for credential management scripts (credmatch, store-api-key, dump-api-keys, get-api-key) following a 4-phase roadmap. The implementation creates a shared security library to eliminate code duplication, implements centralized configuration management, adds audit logging, environment validation, and advanced security features while maintaining backward compatibility and user experience. All enhancements follow bash best practices with shellcheck compliance.",
      "summary": "Successfully implemented centralized security configuration management system with ~/.credmatch/security.conf file (600 permissions), lib/config-manager.sh library with load_security_config() function, comprehensive validation, error handling, and secure defaults. All tests pass and system meets verification criteria.",
